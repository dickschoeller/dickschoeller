## What's here
This is my sandbox for teaching myself new technologies for full stack applications. The main project I use for doing that is **gedbrowser**. There are 3 applications and several supporting libraries in there, all dedicated to editing and displaying genealogy data loaded from GEDCOM files.. The older application, **gedbrowser**, use thymeleaf to create static pages. The newer **gedbrowserng**, is an Angular application. The final application is geoservice, which translates archaic place names into modern ones, to support displaying locations on an embedded Google map.
